A small CLI for generating QR-Codes for Wifi Logins
===================================================

Based on the format described at <https://github.com/zxing/zxing/wiki/Barcode-Contents#wi-fi-network-config-android-ios-11>

Note:
I only tested on a single android devise.
I could not get the WPA2-Enterprise QR-Codes to work
and only testes one WPA2 configuration beyond that.
